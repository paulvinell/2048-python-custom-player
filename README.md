# 2048-python-custom-player

This is a fork of [2048-python](https://github.com/yangshun/2048-python), by [Yanghun Tay](http://github.com/yangshun).

The point of this implementation is to separate game graphics, logic, and player in such a way that it is easy to automate the game.

To start the game, run:

    $ python main.py
